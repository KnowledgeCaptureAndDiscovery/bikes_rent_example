# Bikes rental example

Suppose that our users want to predict the number of bike rentals in a bike sharing service from the weather forecast in an area. A user may hypothesize that in New York bike rentals can be predicted from temperature, humidity, and precipitation. But in Seattle the temperature, BP, and precipitation may be the most important factors, while in Chicago it may be temperature, wind, and precipitation. So we wan to add a new type of question.


## Usage

To run the example, run the following command:

```bash
make docker
```
